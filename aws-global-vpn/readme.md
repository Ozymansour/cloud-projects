User Interface column lists `vit1/vti2` -> these are the IP sec tunnels connected from the customer router to AWS
Note that `10.16.0.0` is the default CIDR range for AWSâ€™s VPC

`B>*` illustrates that 10.16.0.0 is a BGP-learned route, which it learnt from vti1/vit2 (the two IPsec tunnels) of OnPremRouter1
